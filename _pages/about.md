Hello! My name is Sean, and I am an Assistant Research Scientist at the University of Maryland, College Park. I hold a Ph.D. in sociology from George Mason University with a focus on computational sociology, digital sociology, and political economy.

My research focuses on the epistemological challenges and the social, cultural, and political economic conflicts arising from social media and digital technology. I am interested in understanding how individuals come together to make sense of the contemporary world and collectively determine what they see to be true or false in our historical context of platform capitalism, informational surplus, participatory media, and alternative networks of information and disinformation with a focus on the implications for radicalization and political violence.
